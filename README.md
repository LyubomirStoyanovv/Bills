# Bills

Bills is mobile application or better home budgeting which envision the functionality of automatic categorization of expenses into categories and subcategories from a receipt.  For future if the idea develops further to a point when a user could send money to another user and option for contactless payment through the app with the functionality for automatic categorization the user could put constrains of the sent money, so a parent will be sure their children don't spent the money for alchol ect.
